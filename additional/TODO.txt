Corrections:
	! get rid of std calls i.e. tuple, pair, copy, random_engine list, unordered_map top prevent infinite recursions
	! correct atomics (currently not yielding on reads, stores)
	! deadlock detection and analysis
	! main thread exit leads to test abort without checking if threads still running
	- replace time dependent functions -> sleep, clock, gettimeofday, ...
	

New features:


	- use epoch graph for minimal schedule testing -> mark in graph which epochs need to be permuted
		-> additional enables to run threads deterministically in parallel
	- make runtime thread safe
	
	- dump traces to file
	- enable replays from program start
	- enable proper parallel execution
		- random -> generate multiple tests for data race classification
		- parallel search for systematic schedule space exploration
	 ensure safe access of SHM-Container (main process simultaneously reads, while worker writes) 
	
Further new features:

	- test distribution over distributed cores
		- possible systematic distribution
		- random distribution over data races ?!?
		
	- using mpi for single test run -> offload data race detection
